##Biometric Model for Fish Stock

Everything required to run this model is included within the **Bioeconomic_model_final.Rmd**. The code draws upon the research carried out as part of McDonald et al. (2016), *Designing and financing optimal enforcement for small-scale fisheries and dive tourism industries*. Using value function iteration (VFI) and backwards induction, the model evaluates how changes in enforcement level affect fish stock, legal harvest, and illegal harvest over a 20-year timeframe.
